# Mediachain buildbot

This repo exists to build [concat](https://github.com/mediachain/concat) and package binaries
for release.

Future plans include:
- automatic generation of Docker images
- npm publication for [aleph](https://github.com/mediachain/aleph)
- run integration tests before release of either project
